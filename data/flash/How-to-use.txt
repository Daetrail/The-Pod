How-to-use 
The Pod 
stores files 
with text 
inside them. 
However 
there are 
some 
conventions which 
need 
to be followed 
when 
creating your own 
files. 

A program will be 
provided externally 
in 
order to convert 
text 
files into the 
desired 
format of The 
Pod. 
Each 
document MUST 
be 
concise, short and 
specific.
