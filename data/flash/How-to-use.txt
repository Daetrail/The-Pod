How-to-use
The 
Pod
stores files
with 
text
inside 
them.
However
there 
are
some
conventions 
which
need
to be 
followed
when
creating your 
own
files.

A program will 
be
provided 
externally
in
order to 
convert
text
files into 
the
desired
format of 
The
Pod.
Each
document 
MUST
be
concise, short 
and
specific.

Each file must have a 
disposable line as 
the final line of the 
text.
This is due to a 
certain bug in the 
code, where the final 
line would take much 
longer to load.
This 
is automatically done 
by the text 
formatter.
